# Achtung, die Kurve!

In this multiplayer snake game, players control a snake that leaves a trail and try to make their opponents hit a wall or trail first.
The game is controlled by tilting your phone to turn left or right. 
There are power moves (e.g., turbo/slow mode) triggered by special gestures.
